# Scalable Backend Boilerplate  

This repository provides a **scalable backend boilerplate** with essential middleware implementations. It includes authentication and authorization mechanisms using **JWT**, along with a structured approach to organizing routes, middleware, controllers, and models.  

## ðŸš€ Features  

### âœ… JWT Authentication  
- Secure authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**  

### âœ… Middleware Implementation  
- `verifyToken` â†’ Ensures authenticated access  
- `AdminVerify` â†’ Grants role-based access control  

### âœ… Modular Architecture  
- Well-structured **routes, controllers, and models** for maintainability and scalability  

This boilerplate serves as a **solid foundation** for building secure and scalable backend applications. ðŸš€
